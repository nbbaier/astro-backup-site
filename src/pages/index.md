<p id="description" class="mt-0 mb-4">A pithy description</p>

I am a Chicago based linguist interested in syntax, morphology, and typology. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer in the Department of Linguistics at the Univerisity of British Columbia (2019-2020) and a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Linguistics at McGill University (2017-2019). I have a PhD in linguistics from University of California, Berkeley. I also have an M.A. in Linguistics from Berkeley and a B.A. in Linguistics and German from the University of Michigan. I also spent some time in the Department of Linguistics at MIT in the Fall of 2015.
